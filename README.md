0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

In this project we are cloning a simple copy of the AirBnB website using Python.

This will be the very 1st part :
**AirBnB Console.**
+ create our data model
+ manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
+ store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
