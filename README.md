## 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console 🌀

In this project we are cloning a simple copy of the AirBnB website using Python.
This will be the very 1st part :
**AirBnB Console.**
+ create our data model
+ manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
+ store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

- Here is the demo of how to really visualize its inner functionalities

## Must Have 🧰
- Git Version Control
  `git clone https://github.com/Drihmia/AirBnB_clone`
- Ubuntu 20.04 (any Debian Distro will work fine)
- Python 3.11


#### The Technical Console Interface 🚀
- Welcome to the command center of our Airbnb clone project! Buckle up as we navigate through the intricacies of our console, a specialized terminal-like interface tailored for managing the backend storage of our web app.

#### Models Architecture 🏗️
- Our console operates under the watchful eye of the models folder, a powerhouse of functions that orchestrate the command symphony. Within this folder, you'll find Classes, each with a unique role in storing and creating objects. Think of it as a backstage pass to the data extravaganza.

#### JSON Chronicles 📜
- Objects need a home, right? We've chosen a special dwelling: the .json file. Each object gets its own identity, thanks to the mystical uuid.uuid4() model, ensuring a harmonious coexistence without any identity crises.

#### Engine Mechanics 🛠️
- The magic happens in the engine folder, nestled within the models. Dive deep, and you'll uncover the wizardry that enables us to seamlessly store, update, or delete objects by reading and writing to our chosen JSON file.

#### The Console Maestro 🎭
- In the heart of it all, behold the console class. Thanks to the cmd module, we've conjured a shell with the sole purpose of managing the object orchestra. This maestro can compose, destroy, update, list, and perform an all-encompassing object listing extravaganza.

#### Nostalgic Musings on C Programming 🤓
- For those with a hint of C nostalgia, rejoice! Recall the hassles of yesteryear? The cmd module swoops in as the superhero saving us from the programming pitfalls. But, hey, curiosity beckons—ever thought of crafting your own C shell, tuned exclusively for these divine commands? The challenge awaits!

* Embark on this technical journey with confidence, for you now hold the reins to the console's power. Happy coding! 🚀
